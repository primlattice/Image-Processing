Image Processing (Unsupervised machine learning)

FIle name: mnist_task.ipynb

Image processing performed on a set of handwritten numerical digits. The set is split into a training set, where the intention of the writer is known for each digit and a test set were the intent is not known. This is used to train the model which can then be applied to the test set to evaluate the model's precision and accuracy.
