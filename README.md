Image Processing (Unsupervised machine learning)

FIle name: mnist_task.ipynb

Image processing performed on a set of handwritten numerical digits. The set is split into a training set, where the intention of the writer is for each digit is given to the model, and a test set, were the intent is not given. This is used to train the model which can then be applied to the test set to yield results. These can be compared to the intented values to evaluate the model's precision and accuracy.

mnist_task.ipynb can be run as soon as it's downloaded.

Required installations: python3, scikit-learn, jupyter notebook, pandas, numPy, matplotlib

Simply open in jupyter notebook and run all cells to execute the algorithm.
